# Sprint 1: Build a simple Flask app

## Lessons learned

* You must 
```
pip install python-dotenv
``` 
to be able to use `.flaskenv` file

* Relative imports are a mess. Just use absolute imports and decent refactoring tools.

* wow it has been a while: so much about jinja templates that I had forgotten. The little I have learned of react and JSX makes Jinja and Hugo templates look very primitive.

## next up

* give it a production server
* make it run in a docker container
